So here user can see the products based on the categories like we can see when the user clicks on a mobile category all the products which are under the mobile category will get displayed on the screen.

In a similar manner, when we click on other categories all the product-related that category will get displayed on the screen.

And if want user can also search products from the header part. Let's suppose the user search red, so all the products which contain red in their product title will get displayed on the screen.
